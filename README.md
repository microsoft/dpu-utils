# DPU Utilities ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/dpu-utils)![Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dpu-utils/badges/version.svg)
[![Build Status](https://deepproceduralintelligence.visualstudio.com/dpu-utils/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.dpu-utils?branchName=master)](https://deepproceduralintelligence.visualstudio.com/dpu-utils/_build/latest?definitionId=3)


This contains a set of utilities used across projects of the [DPU team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/program/).

## Python

Stored in the `python` subdirectory, published as the `dpu-utils` package.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dpu-utils
```
OR via the community-maintained Conda recipe:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dpu-utils
```

### Overview
Below you can find an overview of the utilities included. Detailed documentation
is provided at the docstring of each class.

##### Generic Utilities `dpu_utils.utils`
* [`ChunkWriter`](python/dpu_utils/utils/chunkwriter.py) provides a convenient API for writing output in multiple parts (chunks).
* [`RichPath`](python/dpu_utils/utils/richpath.py) an API that abstract local and Azure Blob paths in your code.
* [`*Iterator`](python/dpu_utils/utils/iterators.py) Wrappers that can parallelize and shuffle iterators.
* [`{load,save}_json[l]_gz`](python/dpu_utils/utils/dataloading.py) convenience API for loading and writing `.json[l].gz` files.
* [`git_tag_run`](python/dpu_utils/utils/gitlog.py) tags the current working directory git the state of the code.
* [`run_and_debug`](python/dpu_utils/utils/debughelper.py) when an exception happens, start a debug session. Usually a wrapper of `__main__`.

##### General Machine Learning Utilities `dpu_utils.mlutils`
* [`Vocabulary`](python/dpu_utils/mlutils/vocabulary.py) map elements into unique integer ids and back.
    Commonly used in machine learning models that work over discrete data (e.g. 
    words in NLP). Contains methods for converting an list of tokens into their
    "tensorized" for of integer ids.  
* [`BpeVocabulary`](python/dpu_utils/mlutils/bpevocabulary.py) a vocabulary for machine learning models that employs BPE (via `sentencepiece`).
* [`CharTensorizer`](python/dpu_utils/mlutils/chartensorizer.py) convert character sequences into into tensors, commonly used
    in machine learning models whose input is a list of characters.

##### Code-related Utilities `dpu_utils.codeutils`
* [`split_identifier_into_parts()`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/identifiersplitting.py) split identifiers into subtokens on CamelCase and snake_case.
* [`Lattice`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/lattice/lattice.py), [`CSharpLattice`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/lattice/csharplattice.py) represent lattices and useful operations on lattices in Python.
* [`get_language_keywords()`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/keywords/keywordlist.py) an API to retrieve the keyword tokens for many programming languages.
* [`language_candidates_from_suffix()`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/filesuffix.py) a function to retrieve the candidate language given the file suffix.
* [`deduplication.DuplicateDetector`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/deduplication/deduplication.py) API to detects (near)duplicates in codebases.
See also [here](#approximate-duplicate-code-detection) for a command line tool.
* [`treesitter.parser_for`](python/dpu_utils/codeutils/treesitter/parser.py) get [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) parser by language name.

##### TensorFlow 2.x Utilities `dpu_utils.tf2utils`
* [`get_activation_function_by_name`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/activation.py) retrieve activation functions by name.
* [`gelu`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/activation.py) The GeLU activation function.
* [`MLP`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/mlp.py) An MLP layer.

Unsorted segment operations following TensorFlow's [`unsorted_segment_sum`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/math/unsorted_segment_sum) operations:
* [`unsorted_segment_logsumexp`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/unsorted_segment_ops.py)
* [`unsorted_segment_log_softmax`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/unsorted_segment_ops.py)
* [`unsorted_segment_softmax`](python/dpu_utils/tf2utils/unsorted_segment_ops.py)


### Command-line tools

#### Approximate Duplicate Code Detection
You can use the `deduplicationcli` command to detect duplicates in pre-processed source code, by invoking
```bash
deduplicationcli DATA_PATH OUT_JSON
```
where `DATA_PATH` is a file containing tokenized `.jsonl.gz` files and `OUT_JSON` is the target output file.
For more options look at `--help`.

An exact (but usually slower) version of this can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/near-duplicate-code-detector)
along with code to tokenize Java, C#, Python and JavaScript into the relevant formats.

### Tests

#### Run the unit tests

```bash
python setup.py test
```

#### Generate code coverage reports

```bash
# pip install coverage
coverage run --source dpu_utils/ setup.py test && \
  coverage html
```

The resulting HTML file will be in `htmlcov/index.html`.

## .NET

Stored in the `dotnet` subdirectory.

Generic Utilities:
* `Microsoft.Research.DPU.Utils.RichPath`: a convenient way of using both paths and Azure paths in your code.

Code-related Utilities:
* `Microsoft.Research.DPU.CSharpSourceGraphExtraction`: infrastructure to extract Program Graphs from C# projects.
